Exercise 1
----------

Q: In your implementation of env_run() you should have called lcr3().
Before and after the call to lcr3(), your code makes references (at
least it should) to the variable e, the argument to env_run. Upon
loading the %cr3 register, the addressing context used by the MMU is
instantly changed. But a virtual address (namely e) has meaning
relative to a given address context--the address context specifies
the physical address to which the virtual address maps. Why can the
pointer e be dereferenced both before and after the addressing switch?

 Because both page directories (kernel and user mode) has the same
entries for the kernel addresses mapping.

 That way reloading %cr3 register makes no difference, since the 'e'
pointer will have a kernel address, which is correctly mapped in
the just loaded page directory.
