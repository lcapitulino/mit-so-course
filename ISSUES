o Is my memory aligment code correct? Better to review them (boot_alloc(),
  segment_alloc())

o Looks like load_icode() can leak kernel memory

o PSE was implemented and is working, but all the page handling functions
  ignores it and assumes 4KB pages

o Programs using sfork() needs to play some tricks with the global
  'env' pointer in order to not segfault (see sforktree.c). I don't
  know if this' a problem in sfork() implementation or if it's expected
