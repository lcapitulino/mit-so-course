This' my own work on the MIT SO course available at:

http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-828Fall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm

My solutions to the exercises can be found at labs/dditional-files/ directory,
but I suggest you to only look at there (or at the commits history) after you
have tried to do the exercises by your own.
