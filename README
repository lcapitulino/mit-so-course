1. Introduction
---------------

 This' my version of the JOS operating system, built from the MIT's
operating system engineering classes.

 The original course's page used to be hosted at:

http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-828Fall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm

2. Trying it
------------

$ cd src
$ make
$ bochs

3. Source-code directory layout
-------------------------------

|-- boot -> JOS boot loader
|-- conf -> lab config files (not kernel related)
|-- fs   -> file system
|-- inc  -> include files shared between kernel and user modes
|-- kern -> kernel code
|-- lib  -> libOS
`-- user -> user programs

4. Tools' versions
------------------

 JOS has been developed and tested on Mandriva Linux 2007.1,
2008.0 and early 2008.1's development version.

 Important versions of used tools:

o bochs: 2.2.6, 2.3.5
o GCC: 4.1.2, 4.2.2
o binutils: 2.17.50.0.9, 2.17.50.0.12

5. Repository
-------------

 JOS is hosted in a GIT repository at:

http://repo.or.cz/w/mit-so-course.git

 To clone do:

$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/mit-so-course.git

6. Tags
-------

 All important milestone's have been tagged, the most important
ones are the lab's final commit.

 To see all the finals do:

$ git tag -l | grep final

 The grade script should complete with 100% score for all labs
except lab1.

 [ I don't know why lab1's grade script doesn't work. Either I didn't
   tag at the right time or the VGA exercise wasn't done... I don't
   like VGA stuff, I remember I've skipped something... ]

7. Duration
-----------

 If you check my first and last commits, you'll think that the course
took more than 8 months to be done (from 2007-03-04 to 2007-12-10).

 But, if you check carefully you'll realize that there was a pause
of more than three months. That's because I had to stop working on
this project to work on my Google Summer of Code project.

 So, I've spent less than five months on this actually.

 Btw, this was one of the best projects I've worked on my life!
