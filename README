This' my own work on the MIT SO course available at:

http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-828Fall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm

My solutions to the exercises can be found in src/labs/additional-files/
directory, and in the source-code itself.  But I suggest you to only look
at there after you have tried to do the exercises by yourself.
