Q1: The break point test case will either generate a break point
exception or a general protect fault depending on how you initialized
the break point entry in the IDT (i.e., your call to SETGATE from
idt_init). Why? How did you need to set it in order to get the breakpoint
exception to work as specified above?

 To get the breakpoint exception to work as specified above, it's needed
to set the DPL trap's field to 3.

 Otherwise, if it's set to 0, user-mode won't have the appropriate
permission to transfer control to the break point handler. As this is
defined as a protection violation fault the processor will generate a general
protect fault.

Q2: What do you think is the point of these mechanisms, particularly in
light of what the user/softint test program does?

 The point of these mechanisms is to allow user-mode to tranfers control
to the kernel under certain circumstances. It makes possible to implement
some features, like single-step debugging and system calls.
