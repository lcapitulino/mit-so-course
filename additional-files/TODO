Study
=====

o Read about on how the assembly code access and pass C structs to functions

Implementation
==============

o sysenter support was implemented in 'lab3-sysenter-support' branch and is
  working (try grade script). It wasn't merged because it'll probably
  conflict with next labs' code and I don't want to spend time fixing
  rejections (src/sysenter-detect-linux.patch is interesting)

o boot-x86-pt_BR.txt can be better: why does the boot loader does things
  that way? Say more about kernel's GDT and paging

o PSE was implemented and is working, but all the page handling functions
  ignores it and assumes 4KB pages

o Some monitor's commands scan the whole free list to do their job, it's
  possible to do better

o trapentry.S and trap.c has a lot of duplicated code (see lab3 challenge
  at page 13)

o Extend monitor's kdb to do the following:
	- Disassemble support (see lab3 exercise 6's challenge)
	- Print function name, file name and file number
	- Backtrace support

o Machine check exception support

o Aligment check support

o FPU support
