Exercise 7
----------

The first instruction that would do the wrong thing if the boot loader
link address is wrong is this one:

(0) [0x00007c31] 0000:00007c31 (unk. ctxt): jmp far 0008:7c36         ; ea367c0800

which corresponds to this line in boot.S:

ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg

The reason is that, all the labels' addresses are calculated from the entry
point address, but the code is loaded at a fixed address.

So, for example, lets say that you changed the linker address from 0x7C00 to
0x7C08. This will change the 'protcseg' from 0x7C36 to 0x7C3E. But as the
boot loader code was loaded at 0x7C00 address, you'll jump to the wrong
location.
