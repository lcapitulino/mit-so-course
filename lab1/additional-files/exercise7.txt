Exercise 7
----------

The first instruction that would do the wrong thing if the boot loader
link address is wrong is this one:

movw    $start,%sp              # Stack Pointer

Because it sets the stack address at 0x7c00 in the normal case, but if
the link address is wrong, the CPU may override important memory regions.
