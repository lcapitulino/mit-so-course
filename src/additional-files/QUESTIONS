Many doubts... OMG
==================

o PSE was implemented and is working, but all the page handling functions
  ignores it and assumes 4KB pages. Is it a problem?

o The UPAGES mapping has the following permissions:

	pde: 0x00130003 [ 0x00130000 S W P ]
	pte: 0x00118005 [ 0x00118000 U R P ]

  According to Intel manuals, the final permission will be:

	Supervisor Read-Write

  Then users won't have permissions to read the page. Is this right?
  Should this be changed?
