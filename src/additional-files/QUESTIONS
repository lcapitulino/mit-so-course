o Why do we disable interrupts twice in boot.S?

o Why is it necessary to load DS, ES and SS segments with zero at the
  beginning of boot.S? Intel manual says that this registers will be zero
  at initialization time

o The boot loader reads the kernel's elf header at physical address 0x10000,
  was this address choosen at random? Why not 0x1000 (the second page)?

o Is my memory aligment code correct? Better to review them (boot_alloc(),
  segment_alloc())

o Looks like load_icode() can leak kernel memory, take a look at there
