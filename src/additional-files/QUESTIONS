o The boot loader reads the kernel's elf header at physical address 0x10000,
  was this address choosen at random? Also, the boot loader read an entire
  page (4096 bytes) but the elf header is only 52 bytes long. Why do we
  read so much?

o Is my memory aligment code correct? Better to review them (boot_alloc(),
  segment_alloc())

o Looks like load_icode() can leak kernel memory, take a look at there
