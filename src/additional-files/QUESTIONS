Many doubts... OMG
==================

o The boot loader reads the kernel's elf header at physical address 0x10000,
  was this address choosen at random? Also, the boot loader read an entire
  page (4096 bytes) but the elf header is only 52 bytes long. Why do we
  read so much?

o PSE was implemented and is working, but all the page handling functions
  ignores it and assumes 4KB pages. Is it a problem?

o The UPAGES mapping has the following permissions:

	pde: 0x00130003 [ 0x00130000 S W P ]
	pte: 0x00118005 [ 0x00118000 U R P ]

  According to Intel manuals, the final permission will be:

	Supervisor Read-Write

  Then users won't have permissions to read the page. Is this right?
  Should this be changed?

o Some monitor's commands scan the whole free list to do their job, but
  I think that there're smarter ways to do it (ie, no need to scan the
  whole list)
