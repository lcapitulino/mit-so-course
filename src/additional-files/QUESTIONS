Many doubts... OMG
==================

o The boot loader reads the kernel's elf header at physical address 0x10000,
  was this address choosen at random? Also, the boot loader read an entire
  page (4096 bytes) but the elf header is only 52 bytes long. Why do we
  read so much?

o PSE was implemented and is working, but all the page handling functions
  ignores it and assumes 4KB pages.

o Some monitor's commands scan the whole free list to do their job, it's
  possible to do better

o Is my memory aligment code correct? Better to review them (boot_alloc(),
  segment_alloc())

o Looks like load_icode() can leak kernel memory, take a look at there
