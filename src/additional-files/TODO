Study
=====

o Read about on how the assembly code access and pass C structs to functions

Implementation
==============

o sysenter support was implemented in 'lab3-sysenter-support' branch and is
  working (try grade script). It wasn't merged yet for two reasons.

  First, next labs will add a lot of code and I don't want to spend time
  fixing rejections.

  Second, in the current implementation it drops support for the old 'int'
  method, which will make JOS not to run on Pentium processors. Consider
  Linus' solution for this problem: http://lwn.net/Articles/18414/

  So, maybe it can be merged after next lab or so.

o boot-x86-pt_BR.txt can be better: why does the boot loader does things
  that way? Say more about kernel's GDT and paging

o PSE was implemented and is working, but all the page handling functions
  ignores it and assumes 4KB pages

o Some monitor's commands scan the whole free list to do their job, it's
  possible to do better

o trapentry.S and trap.c has a lot of duplicated code (see lab3 challenge
  at page 13)

o Extend monitor's kdb to do the following:
	- Disassemble support (see lab3 exercise 6's challenge)
	- Print function name, file name and file number
	- Backtrace support

o Machine check exception support

o Aligment check support
