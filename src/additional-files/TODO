o boot-x86-pt_BR.txt can be better: why does the boot loader does things
  that way? Say more about kernel's GDT and paging

o PSE was implemented and is working, but all the page handling functions
  ignores it and assumes 4KB pages

o Some monitor's commands scan the whole free list to do their job, it's
  possible to do better

o I need to understand better how protection works at the segment level
  (eg, RPL vs. CPL)

o Read about how the assembly code access and pass C structs to functions
