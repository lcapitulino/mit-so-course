Q1: What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each
exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to
the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation
could not be provided?)

 The purpose of having individual handler function for each
exception/interrupt is to let the operating system choose easily what
exceptions/interrupts it's going to handle and to have different
settings for each of them.

 If all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the same handler, the
operating system would have to enable the exceptions/interrupts by
software making it more complex, and there would be only one setting
possible (eg, software would always invoke or not).

 Also, the operating system would have to provide a very big function
to handle everything, which is a bad design choice.
