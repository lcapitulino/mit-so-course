Q1: What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each
exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to
the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation
could not be provided?)

 The purpose of having individual handler function for each
exception/interrupt is to allow the operating system to:

 o Choose what exceptions/interrupts it want to handle in a clean way
 o Have different settings for different handlers

  If all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the same handler, it
wouldn't be possible to implement system calls by using software interrupts,
because we'd have to allow the user to invoke any exception/interrupt by
software. This has security implications.

 Also, the operating system would have to provide a very big function
to handle everything, which is a bad design choice that would make
things very complex.

Q2: Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave
correctly (i.e., as the grade script expects)? Why is this the correct
behavior? What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's int $14
instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler (which is interrupt
number 14)?

 I didn't have to do anything, because I do not allow user-mode to invoke
the page fault handler.

 This is the correct behavior because the page fault handler does its job
by checking the error code (which has a special format) and, when invoked
from user-mode, the error code has bogus information that can drive the
page fault handler to perform the wrong operation, leading to system
crash.
