Q1: What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each
exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to
the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation
could not be provided?)

 The purpose of having individual handler function for each
exception/interrupt is to allow the operating system to:

 o Choose what exceptions/interrupts it want to handle in a clean way
 o Have different settings for different handlers

  If all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the same handler, it
wouldn't be possible to implement system calls by using software interrupts,
because we'd have to allow the user to invoke any exception/interrupt by
software. This has security implications.

 Also, the operating system would have to provide a very big function
to handle everything, which is a bad design choice that would make
things very complex.
