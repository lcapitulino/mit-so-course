Exercise 5
==========

In the file kern/pmap.c, you must implement code for the five functions:
page_init(), page_alloc(), page_free(), pgdir_walk(), page_insert(),
page_remove()

Q1: What is the maximum amount of physical memory that this operating
system can support? Why?

 This operating system can support up to 256MB of memory. The reason for
this limitation is that we have mapped the kernel between the range
0xF0000000 and 0xFFFFFFFF (which is 256MB long) so, there's no way to
reference addresses greater than 4GB w/o using special hardware
capabilities.

 To use more than 256MB, we should map the kernel below the current base
address of 0xF0000000.
